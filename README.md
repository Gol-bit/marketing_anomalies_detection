📊 Conversion Anomalies Detection
Conversion Anomalies Detection is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes marketing conversion data, identifies anomalies, and highlights unusual trends in key performance metrics.

🎯 Goal
The notebook helps detect irregularities in conversion rates that may indicate fraud, tracking issues, or unexpected user behavior.

📌 Approach
Data Preprocessing

Loads and formats marketing data.
Groups data into 2-day intervals for trend analysis.
Metric Calculation

Computes IPM (Installs per 1000 Impressions), CPM (Clicks per 1000 Impressions), and Click2Action (Conversions per Clicks).
Applies log transformation for better data distribution.
Anomaly Detection

Uses probability-based methods to compare metric values with historical medians.
Flags anomalies where deviations are statistically significant.
Insights & Visualization

Generates structured reports on detected anomalies.
Plots metric trends with highlighted min/max values.
(Optional) Telegram Alerts

Sends automated messages summarizing anomalies.
